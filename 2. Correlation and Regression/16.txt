Adding A Line
We can use abline() to add any line we like, as long as the first argument is the intercept and the second is the slope. Let's try it out! money and prosocial are still saved in your console.

Instructions

Add a line of code to show the mean value of the dependent variable
Remember that the mean line is constant accross all values of the independent variable, so there is no slope!






# Your plot
plot(money, prosocial, xlab = "Money", ylab = "Prosocial Behavior")
# Your regression line
line <- lm(prosocial ~ money)
abline(line)
# Add a line that shows the mean of the dependent variable
abline(mean(prosocial), 0)
