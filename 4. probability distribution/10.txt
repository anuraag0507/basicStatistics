The binomial distribution
The binomial distribution is important for discrete variables. 
There are a few conditions that need to be met before you can consider a random variable to binomially distributed:

There is a phenomenon or trial with two possible outcomes and a constant probability 
of success - this is called a Bernoulli trial
All trials are independent
Other ingredients that are essential to a binomial distribution 
is that we need to observe a certain number of trials, let's call this n, and we count the number of successes in which we are interested, let's call this x. Useful summary statistics for a binomial distribution are the same as for the normal distribution: the mean and the standard deviation.

The mean is calculated by multiplying the number of trials n by the 
probability of a success denoted by p. The standard deviation of a binomial distribution is calculated by the following formula: .

Instructions
Consider an example where we have made an exam consisting of 25 multiple choice questions. 
Each questions has 5 possible answers. This means that the probability of answering a question correctly by chance is 0.2. Calculate the mean of this distribution and store it in a variable called mean_chance
Calculate the standard deviation of this distribution and store it in the variable std_chance.







# calculate the mean and store it in the variable mean_chance
mean_chance <- 25 * 0.2

# calculate the standard deviation and store it in the variable std_chance
std_chance <- sqrt(25 * 0.2 * (1 - 0.2))
