Other Types Of Confidence Intervals II
Let's do the same thing again with your original study that looked at how often people get angry when they're driving. The data from this study was from a sample of 200, and the results are saved in your console as rrage if you need them. We left you the code from where you calculated the 95% confidence interval. Now let's try finding the 90% confidence interval (corresponding to a T score of 1.6525), and comparing what happens when we use these different intervals.

Instructions

In your console, copy the steps from your script, and use this to calculate the range of the 95% confidence interval
In your console, copy and adapt the code from your script to calculate the range of the 90% confidence interval
In your script, report the ranges of each interval
In your script, report which confidence interval is larger as a single number (95 or 90)




# Assign the sample mean to object "m"
m <- mean(rrage)
# Assign the sample standard error to object "s"
s <- sd(rrage) / sqrt(200)
# Calculate the upper level of the 95% confidence interval
m + ( 1.9720 * s )
# Calculate the lower level of the 95% confidence interval
m - ( 1.9720 * s)
# Calculate the range of the 95% confidence interval
3.88326
# Calculate the range of the 90% confidence interval
3.2541
# Which has the widest range?
95
