You are picking flowers from a garden. The garden contains flowers of varying colors, including flowers that are completely blue, flowers that are completely pink, and also flowers that are both colours. The probability of picking a flower that is at least partly blue is 0.4 and the probability of picking a flower that is at least partly pink is 0.2. Let's think about some probabilities!

Calculate the answers to the question in your script
Assume that the events are independent
Remember you'll have to find the intersection between blue and pink so you don't count this area twice!



# Calculate the probability of picking a flower that is blue, pink or both
0.2 + 0.4 - (0.2 * 0.4)
