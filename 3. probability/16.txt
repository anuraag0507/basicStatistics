Joint and Marginal Probabilities
Enter plants into your console to see frequency information about 90 plants in a shop. We have recorded whether a plant lives indoors or outdoors, and whether it is a flower, a succulent or a tree.

You can calculate the probabilities of a given plant and living conditions based on the frequency with which this occurs in the table. For example, the probability of a plant being a tree is 14/90 = 0.1555556.
